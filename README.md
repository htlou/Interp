# My Learning and other stuff in interpretability
## Before the real study
1. Re-learning the introduction of Transformers: finish the three videos in the **What is a Transformer** (along with its code)
    a. proof: Clean_Transformer_Demo_Template.ipynb
    b. Time: ~4h, including the code finishing(have to say some bugs are really annoying)
2. The Exploratory Analysis Demo Tutorial
    a. proof: Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb
    b. Time: ~2h, Since no coding is needed
3. General paper reading of mech interp(since I already took a surveyon it about a year ago, it's quite easy)
    a. papers: see papers.md
    b. Time: Alas, didn't remember that, because I just kind of going through them in many time pieces
