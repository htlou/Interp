# My Learning and other stuff in interpretability
## Before the real study
1. Re-learning the introduction of Transformers: finish the three videos in the **What is a Transformer** (along with its code)
    a. proof: Clean_Transformer_Demo_Template.ipynb
    b. Time: ~4h, including the code finishing(have to say some bugs are really annoying)
2. The Exploratory Analysis Demo Tutorial
    a. proof: Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb
    b. Time: ~2h, Since no coding is needed
3. General paper reading of mech interp(since I already took a surveyon it about a year ago, it's quite easy)
    a. papers: see papers.md
    b. Time: Alas, didn't remember that, because I just kind of going through them in many time pieces

## Entering the real study time
1. Early stage reading and thinking: paper.md
2. Hands-on and experiments: hands_on.md
Note that these two markdowns also serves as some kind of note to myself, so it may contain some offensive words and might be a little nagging.
I believed I explained every files, what I did to them and what I get from them, in these three markdowns (including this one). So it's quite self-containing.
